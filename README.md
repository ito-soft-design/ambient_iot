# AmbientIot

This is a Ruby Gem library to access Ambient ( https://ambidata.io ) service which is provided by AmbientData Inc.  
You can upload data (such as a IoT) to Ambient.  
Then Ambient draw a Graph of the data.  

AmbientIot is a port from [ambient-python-lib](https://github.com/AmbientDataInc/ambient-python-lib).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ambient_iot'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ambient_iot

## Usage

First, you should get an account for Ambient.  
Next you make a channel on the Ambient.  
Then you can get a channel id, a write key and a read key for the channel.  

### Uploading data:

Ambient data takes keys d1 to d8.  
You set a data as a hash.  

    require 'ambient_iot'

    channel_id = 1234     # set your channel id here
    write_key = "abc.."   # set write key of the channel
    client = AmbientIot::Client.new channel_id, write_key:write_key # create a client

    client << { d1:1, d2:2, d3:3}   # append a data
    client.sync                     # send to Ambient site

Timestamp is automatically added.  
If you don't want to set timestamp, set false the timestamp property.

    client.append_timestamp = false

In this case, timestamp is set by Ambient.


### Getting uploaded data:

    require 'ambient_iot'

    channel_id = 1234     # set your channel id here
    read_key = "abc.."    # set read key of the channel
    client = AmbientIot::Client.new channel_id, read_key:read_key # create a client

    client.read
    # => [
    #      {:d1=>1, :d2=>2, :d3=>3, :created=>2018-04-27 23:13:18 +0900},
    #        .
    #      {:d1=>2, :d2=>1, :created=>2018-04-24 00:00:00 +0900}
    #    ]

    # with specific date
    client.read date:Time.new(2018, 4, 26)

    # with specific range
    client.read start:Time.new(2018, 4, 20), end:Time.new(2018, 4, 26)

    # with number of data
    client.read n:1, step:5

### Getting a channel information

    require 'ambient_iot'

    channel_id = 1234     # set your channel id here
    read_key = "abc.."    # set read key of the channel
    client = AmbientIot::Client.new channel_id, read_key:read_key # create a client

    client.info           # get
    # => {:ch=>"1234", :user=>"1234", :created=>2018-04-23 22:59:06 +0900, :modified=>2018-04-27 23:23:59 +0900, :lastpost=>2018-04-27 23:13:25 +0900, :charts=>1, :chName=>"Temperature", :chDesc=>"Temperature of the room", :d1=>{:name=>"data1", :color=>"1"}, :d2=>{:name=>"data2", :color=>"2"}, :d3=>{:name=>"", :color=>"3"}, :d4=>{:name=>"", :color=>"4"}, :d5=>{:name=>"", :color=>"5"}, :d6=>{:name=>"", :color=>"6"}, :d7=>{:name=>"", :color=>"7"}, :d8=>{:name=>"", :color=>"8"}, :public=>false, :showlocation=>false, :photoid=>"", :phototitle=>"", :dataperday=>1}
